* Container Orchestration
    * A container orchestration tool helps in deployment, scaling, networking, and monitoring of your containers.  
    * It provides a framework for managing containers and the microservices they contain at scale.
    * As developers we focus on the code being deployed, container orchestration tools help by abstracting the deployment details

    * Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool.
    *  It provides tools that help deploy and manage containers that run over a network. 
        *  It lets us build application services that span multiple containers, schedule containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage their health over time.  
    * Similar tools are Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos
