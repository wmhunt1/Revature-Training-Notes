* AJAX
    * Stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML 
    * Web dev technique used for updating your page with information from a server without reloading it 
    * The XML part of AJAX is there because traditionally, the data sent across networks use XML as a format 
        * Remember SOAP 
    * But you can now send data in JSON format (yay)
* XMLHttpRequest
    * Main actor of AJAX 
    * Object that is used to send a request to the server and receive the response 
        * Again the XML in its name is for traditional reasons
* Fetch API
    * JS interface for making http requests and processing server responses
    *  Uses promises to achieve asynchronisity 
        * Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value 
        * Promises are objects in JS
