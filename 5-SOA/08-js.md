Javascript fundamentals
JS for short
no correlation to java
loosely typed (doesnt mean it doesn't have data types)
functional language (has some OO support. More object based and not object oriented tho)
interpreted, not compiled 

ECMASCRIPT
standardization of JS
just like how html has html5, JS has ES6 the latest standardized version 

SUNBONS(aka the data types in js)
symbols
undefined
no value 
null
is still a value 
boolean
objects
functions are also a data type but theyre treated as objects in JS
numbers
strings

Scope in JS
scope of a variable describes where it exists
3 scopes
functional
global
block
somewhat related to a variable declaration
when you declare a variable using var because of hoisting it ends up having a global scope
when you declare a variable using let, it limits the scope of a variable to the block it is declared in
thus, make let not var 
use let to declare ur variables and not the var keyword 

other types of variable declaration
to declare an object use the object literal syntax
