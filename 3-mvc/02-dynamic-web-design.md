* DOM
    * Document Object Model 
    * Representation of your HTML document as a tree (made up of nodes) that can be modified using JS
    *  Used to change document structure, style, and content at runtime
* Selectors
    * These are used to identify elements in your DOM 
    * Types: 
        * document.getElementById() 
        * document.getElementsByClassName()
        *  document.getElementsByTagName() 
        * document.querySelector() 
        * document.querySelectorAll()
* Events
    * Any type of interaction with the web page 
        * User interactions such as clicking a button
    *  Any significant change in page state 
        * Such as when certain elements have been loaded
* Dynamic Web Design
    * A web page is dynamic if it reacts to user interaction 
        * For example, clicking a button should be able to result in something occuring in your web page 
    * If you have a web page that does not change with user interaction then the web page is static (also very boring)
* Event handling with JS
    * Event handlers 
        * Functions that get called when an event happens 
    * Event listeners
        *  Added to elements, call an event handler when a certain event occurs
