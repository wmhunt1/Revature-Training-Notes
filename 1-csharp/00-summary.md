* Intro to .NET
    * What is .Net?
        * Free, and open source development platform

        * An object-oriented and type-safe coding language.
    * What is the starting point of a program?
        * The entry point 
    * What is OOP?
        * Breaking code down into classes for reusability
    * What is type safety
        * Prevents type errors but not allowing you to switch data types.
* .Net Architecture
    * What is an SDK?
        * Software development kit like VSC
    * What's the role of the CLR?: Common language runtime
        * converts managed code into native code and run the program
    * What's the role of BCL?
        * Base class library: Provides built in data types and functions
    * What is managed code?
        * Code that is managed by a run time
    * What is unmanaged code?
        * Code made outside
    * What's the garbage collection process?
        * Automatic memory management. Checks for items in the managed heap (where reference type objects are allocated) that are no longer needed and gets rid of them to clear out memory
* Data Types
    * What is a data type?
        * Defined by values it can take, language, or operations that can be performed
    * What are the different data types in C#?
        * String, number, boolean, array
    * Value types vs reference types?
        * Directly stores data vs storing reference
    * What is CTS?
        * Common type System - The CTS is a standard definition of the types in .NET compliant languages.
    * What is language interoperability?
        * ability for languages to interact
    * What is CLS? How is it related to CTS?
        * Common language specification 
* App Architecture

    * What is the difference between projects and namescapes?
    * How many projects can be included in a solution?
* Collections
    * What are collections?
        * A class used to represent a set of similar data types as one unit and are used to group and manage related objects. For example, lists, queues, arrays, stacks.
    * What is the root interface of the collections hierarchy?
    * What is the IEnumerable for?
    * Arrays vs ArrayList vs List<T>?
    * What is a dictionary?
    * Stack vs queue?

    * What is variance? How is it related to polymorphism?
    * What are the different type variances?
    * What are the different ways to type cast?
    * What are the different ways to check a type?
    * Why is type checking important? 
* OOP Pillars
    * What are the 4 OOP pillars?
    * What is the difference between encapsulation and abstraction?
    * What are some use cases for abstraction? Polymorphism? Inheritance? Encapsulation?
    * Besides having an is-a relationship, what other object relationships are there?
