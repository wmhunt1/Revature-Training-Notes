* What is the cloud?
    * A collection of servers owned by some service provider
    * 3 main cloud service providers are: AWS by Amazon Azure by Microsoft GCP by Google
* Benefits
    * Cost - Because you pay as you go(/need) you don’t really have to worry about maintenance costs, electrical bills, and having to hire extra IT people to manage your infrastructure. 
    * Scaling - It’s very simple to scale your applications as you grow. (Can literally be done through a click of a button)
    * Security - Gain access to the most robust security possible (provided by the cloud provider), helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from threats.
* Scaling
    * Horizontal 
        * Scaling by adding or removing instances of a service, resource, or application. 
        * For example, deploying multiple copies of your web app across different servers stationed at different places. 
        * Usually cheaper. 
    * Vertical 
        * Scaling by increasing or decreasing the specs of the servers your service, resource, or application uses.
        * For example, increasing the RAM of the server your webapp runs on.
* Cloud Service Types
    * IaaS 
        * Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. You configure it the same way you’d configure your servers.  
    * PaaS 
        * Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
    * SaaS 
        * Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
* Cloud Deployment Models
    * Private 
        * Could be on premise or could also be provided by a service provider. Only accessible by a certain organization.  
    * Public 
        * Cloud services and servers that are open for use by the general public. 
    * Hybrid 
        * When you have some resources on premise/private and some hosted on the public cloud. 
    *  Community 
        * Sharing is caring. Sharing resources when you are part of a community, for example universities cooperating in certain areas of research.
