* What is SDLC
    * A process used to design, develop and test high quality software
    * Describes how a certain software was developed
    * Stands for software development life cycle
* Big-Bang Model
    * 3 phases: Design? Build!!!! Test? 
    * Good for prototypes, learning new languages and implementing some new feature without integrating it into the application
* Waterfall Method
    * Rigid
    * Highly documented
    * You go through each phase once Good for projects that require on time delivery
    * Like software for rockets, or military projects
    * Phases: Requirements => Design => Implementation => Verification => Maintenance
* V-Model
    * AKA verification and validation model 
    * An extension of the waterfall model and is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage
    * the corresponding testing phase of the development phase is planned in parallel
* Agile
    * Agile is more of a concept than an actual methodology unlike the first three models
    * It’s about being able to develop and deploy software quickly by not wasting time discussing design and planning
    * It’s about communicating consistently with the client and stakeholders about what they would want in the project and making plans on applying their requests in an iterative way so that the current development wouldn’t be disturbed 
    * Read all about it here: https://agilemanifesto.org/
* Scrum artifacts
    * Backlog
    * Project Log
    * Burndown chart
* Backlog
    * Contains the user stories that need to be implemented
    * Each user story would have a point value, the value is the amount of effort it would take to implement the user story
    *  During sprint planning, you would assess which user stories to implement based on their urgency and match the total points against your capacity - the total amount of work hours you actually have
* Project Board
    * How you keep track of the project during development
    * Maintained by the scrum master
* Burndown chart
    * Another way of keeping track of your progress during a sprint 
    * Is used in sprint review to see the sprint’s velocity 
    * The velocity describes the total amount of points finished during sprint
* Yolo Developent
    * Similar to Big Bang, but it makes it into production
    * Only has one iteration like in waterfall 
    * Flexible(?) to changing requirements like in agile
    * All about taking requirements from product owner/ project manager and coming up with something to show on project presentation
    * Most apps developed under YOLO development are made once, released, and never updated  
    * Start (Some sort of requirements) >>>>>>Start panicking>>>>>>>Panic (Rechecking the requirements, refactoring the code)  >>>>>>>>>Panic some more>>>>>>>End (Some sort of MVP, released to production)
